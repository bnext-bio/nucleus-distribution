Traditional publishing can take years to share important immediate results or negative results. Further, useful information is often buried deep within PDFs or not available at all, slowing down the process of research. Nucleus is intended to be a knowledge sharing platform that emphasizes reproducibility and accessibility that should improve the quality of research and complement existing knowledge sharing practices.","type":"content","url":"/docs/about/faqs#id-1-how-is-sharing-through-nucleus-different-from-existing-options","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"FAQs","lvl2":"2.

If your university holds the patent you may have to petition them to license the contribution using a suitable tool that provides a patent license (e.g. \n\nCERN-OHL-P-2.0). In general, unless a technology is being actively commercialized, a patent can hinder innovation if it prevents the technology from being used by others. Open access licensing will help fulfill the goals of making technology available for the public benefit in such instances.","type":"content","url":"/docs/about/faqs#id-3-what-if-i-have-a-module-that-i-want-to-contribute-but-is-subject-to-a-patent","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"FAQs","lvl2":"4.

In general, if a journal accepts content that has been previously placed on a preprint server, then they should also accept content that has been shared as a DevNote. Of course, you should check specific journal policies to be sure.\n\nDevNotes are intended to complement existing publishing practices. For example,\n\nValidating a component in your own hands that has been described in a previous publication.\n\nSharing negative results that might never make it into a publication.\n\nDocumenting small tips and tricks that typically fall outside the scope of existing journals\n\nServing as a user friendly guide for sharing results after publication to increase impact and usability of parts and data\n\nNucleus is a great way for sharing the reproduction of an existing result while also providing the community with valuable, high quality data and user experience.

Martha had started it after the war. One book at a time. Then photographs. Then letters from people who were dead now. The dust gathered on everything equally. The valuable and the worthless. The collection did not care. Visitors would ask about certain items. Martha would tell them stories. Some were true. Others had become true through repetition. The best pieces were not always the most expensive ones. Sometimes a postcard meant more than a painting. A shell from a beach in Normandy worth more than silver. At night, Martha would walk past the collection. In the darkness, everything looked the same. Just shapes on shelves. Shadows of things that had mattered to someone. She knew she would never sell any of it. Collections were not about money. They were about time. About keeping something when everything else got lost. The collection would outlive her. Someone else would inherit these objects. They would not know the stories. The meaning would die with her. This did not make her sad.
