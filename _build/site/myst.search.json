Traditional publishing can take years to share important immediate results or negative results. Further, useful information is often buried deep within PDFs or not available at all, slowing down the process of research. Nucleus is intended to be a knowledge sharing platform that emphasizes reproducibility and accessibility that should improve the quality of research and complement existing knowledge sharing practices.","type":"content","url":"/docs/about/faqs#id-1-how-is-sharing-through-nucleus-different-from-existing-options","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"FAQs","lvl2":"2.

If your university holds the patent you may have to petition them to license the contribution using a suitable tool that provides a patent license (e.g. \n\nCERN-OHL-P-2.0). In general, unless a technology is being actively commercialized, a patent can hinder innovation if it prevents the technology from being used by others. Open access licensing will help fulfill the goals of making technology available for the public benefit in such instances.","type":"content","url":"/docs/about/faqs#id-3-what-if-i-have-a-module-that-i-want-to-contribute-but-is-subject-to-a-patent","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"FAQs","lvl2":"4.

In general, if a journal accepts content that has been previously placed on a preprint server, then they should also accept content that has been shared as a DevNote. Of course, you should check specific journal policies to be sure.\n\nDevNotes are intended to complement existing publishing practices. For example,\n\nValidating a component in your own hands that has been described in a previous publication.\n\nSharing negative results that might never make it into a publication.\n\nDocumenting small tips and tricks that typically fall outside the scope of existing journals\n\nServing as a user friendly guide for sharing results after publication to increase impact and usability of parts and data\n\nNucleus is a great way for sharing the reproduction of an existing result while also providing the community with valuable, high quality data and user experience.

Note: we recommend that you always work off of a copy of the template file and never edit the template file itself so that it can serve as a working reference.\n- [ ]  Inspect the output of the directory. In the Launcher Window (Main Panel), click Curvenote Preview and then select your renamed template file.\n- [ ]  Change the title and author of your DevNote by opening the file `curvenote.yml` from the File Directory and modify the corresponding fields:\n\n```markdown\n# Ensure your title is the same as in your `main.md`\n  title: \"An Unexpected Enzyme in PURE\"  \n  subtitle: \"The enzyme MTHFS is needed for 36 pot PURE\"\n  description:  \n# Add any supporting files to the toc, but ensure that your main manuscript\n# is first is the list.

Click the Template icon, select `/analysis/platereader.ipynb`, and click GO. Note: there is a working analysis notebook already in the directory to serve as a reference: `20250220-analysis.ipynb`.\n- [ ]  Link this notebook to your DevNote by including a reference to it in your `curvenote.yml` file as follows:\n\n```markdown\n# Add any supporting files to the toc, but ensure that your main manuscript\n# is first is the list. The title field is optional.\n  toc:\n    - file: main.md\n    - file: ./experiments/experiment-01/my-platereader.ipynb\n      title: Analysis Notebook\n```\n\n- [ ]  In the newly created Jupyter Notebook, adjust the paths to your platemap and data file respectively.\n- [ ]  Run the notebook cells.\n- [ ]  The figure output of a cell can be referenced in two ways. We recommend using both.\n    - [ ]  Option 1: save the output of a cell to the `/analysis/` directory by adding the following code to the end of the cell:\n    \n    ```python\n    plt.savefig(./analysis/my-fig.png)\n    ```\n    \n    - [ ]  Option 2: label the cell by adding the following syntax to the top of the cell:\n    \n    ```markdown\n    #| label: fig:name-of-figure\n    ```\n    \n    - **Note: complete documentation of MyST Markdown is available online**\n        \n        MyST specification: https://mystmd.org/spec\n        \n- [ ]  If the output of a cell is a table rather than a figure , it can be referenced as follows:\n    - [ ]  Label the cell by adding the following syntax to the top of the cell:\n    \n    ```markdown\n    #| label: tbl:name-of-table\n    ```\n    \n\n### **Reference figures in `main.md`**\n\n- [ ]  A figure can be generated in two ways depending on how you want to reference it:\n    - [ ]  Option 1: reference the saved file:\n    \n    ```markdown\n    :::{figure} ./experiments/experiment-01/my-fig.png\n    :name: name-of-fig\n    :align: center\n    :width: 50%\n    \n    My caption\n    :::\n    ```\n    \n    - [ ]  Option 2: reference the output of a labelled jupyter cell:\n    \n    ```markdown\n    :::{figure} #fig:name-of-figure\n    :kind: table\n    :name: name-of-fig\n    :width: 50%\n    \n    My caption\n    :::\n    ```\n    \n    - [ ]  Multiple figures can be handled elegently by using tabs:\n    \n    ```markdown\n    :::::{tab-set}\n    \n    ::::{tab-item} Tab Title 1\n    :sync: tab1\n    :::{figure} #fig:name-of-figure-1\n    :name: name-of-fig-1\n    :align: center\n    :width: 50%\n    \n    My caption 1\n    :::\n    ::::\n    \n    ::::{tab-item} Tab Title 2\n    :sync: tab2\n    :::{figure} ./experiments/experiment-01/my-fig-2.png\n    :name: name-of-fig-2\n    :align: center\n    :width: 50%\n    \n    My caption 2\n    :::\n    ::::\n    \n    :::::\n    ```\n    \n- [ ]  A table output can be included from a labelled jupyter cell as follows:\n    \n    ```markdown\n    :::{figure} #tbl:name-of-table\n    :kind: table\n    :name: name-of-table\n    \n    My caption\n    :::\n    ```\n    \n- [ ]  Figures and tables can be referenced in documents using the following syntax:\n    \n    ```markdown\n    This point is illustrated in {ref}`name-of-fig`.\n    ```\n    \n- [ ]  Verify that the changes have been made by clicking Curvenote Preview.
