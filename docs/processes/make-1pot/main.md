# Overview

Making PURE requires making Protein Mix, which contains the thirty-six (36) proteins in the PURE system. If you want to purify each protein individually, you can follow our [36-pot protocol](../make-36pot/main.md). However, if you want working protein mix with less time and effort, you can co-express and co-purify all 36 proteins at once in OnePot. This protocol shows you how. This protocol has been established to grow, purify, and characterize OnePot PURE proteins following [Lavickova’s OnePot PURE protocol](10.3791/62625) with a few deviations.
