# Overview

This protocol describes the Process for making the thirty-six component proteins of the Base Cytosol. It can be broken down into 5 sub-processes:

1. Prepare buffers and gravity columns.
2. Grow cultures of *E. coli* expression strains for each protein.
3. Lyse each culture and purify target proteins by Ni2+ affinity column.
4. Measure the concentration and purity of each protein.
5. Combine proteins into a final Protein Mix.
